The more unique and innovative your conversations, the more points you will get. Repetitive sessions, including those you've previously submitted yourself and comparable ones submitted by other users, are likely to receive 0 points.


## 2. Referrals
After installing Aggregata, you can click `Reward` to obtain and copy your invite code. 

- For each successful download through your invite code, you will receive 10% of the referred user's claimed points in perpetuity. 
- The person using your code will also receive additional 10% points as they use and claim. 
This reward is ongoing and will not expire.

**Referral history and bonus rewards will be updated to show in later releases.**
